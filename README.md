# SysML Profile for PDDL Integration

This repository contains a specially developed SysML profile for integrating the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) into SysML-based system models.

The profile is designed to bridge the gap between Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and planning logics. It establishes a direct link between SysML modeling elements and PDDL planning elements, thus supporting seamless integration of system modeling and planning processes.
